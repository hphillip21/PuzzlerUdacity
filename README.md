My Udacity coursework - Puzzler project and writeup
*****************************
Project 4 - Puzzler
by Hunter Phillips
*****************************

GoogleVR app designed for Google Cardboard based on Simon Says where a pattern is displayed using 5 floating orbs, 
and the user is then tasked with repeating that 
pattern by clicking on the same orbs in the same sequence.

I spent roughly 24 hours working on this project.
